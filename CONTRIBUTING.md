## Contributing

We welcome contributions from team members.

Suggested workflow:
1. Create a feature branch:
   `git checkout -b feat/<short-desc>`
2. Make your changes and commit with a descriptive message:
   `git commit -m "feat: add <feature>"`
3. Push your branch and open a Pull Request describing the change.
4. Link the PR to any relevant issue and request a review from a team member.
