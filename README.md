## Overview
Edu-Workflow is an academic project focused on designing and developing a unified system to automate institutional workflows and monitor performance across academic institutions. The platform aims to replace fragmented and manual processes with a structured, transparent, and data-driven digital solution.

The project emphasizes real-world problem solving, system design, and collaborative software development within an academic environment.

---

## Problem Statement
Academic institutions manage a wide range of administrative, academic, and operational workflows such as admissions, attendance, assessments, faculty workload management, approvals, and student services. These processes are often handled through disconnected systems or manual procedures, resulting in operational delays, limited transparency, and challenges in tracking performance and accountability.

There is a need for an integrated platform that consolidates these workflows and enables real-time monitoring, analytics, and reporting to support informed decision-making and efficient governance.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze and understand institutional workflows in academic environments  
- Design an automated workflow management system  
- Enable real-time monitoring and visibility into institutional processes  
- Improve transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency  
- Provide students with hands-on experience in system design and development  

---

## Proposed Solution
The project proposes the development of an automated workflow and performance monitoring system that consolidates academic and administrative processes into a single digital platform. The system will support role-based access, workflow automation, real-time tracking, and analytical insights to help institutions improve efficiency and decision-making.
